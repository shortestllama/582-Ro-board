2. Figure out general game stuff. What game, how robot interacts with it.
3. Develop app to play game with robot.
4. Improve app and robot interaction with people.

Small enough that the robot can reach it with just its arm
Game pieces are able to be picked up with just 3 points of contact
Generally simple game.
Need to measure its range of movement
Only a few locations of the arm.
